        "*   The `VulnerabilitySpotter` was implemented with basic linear layers to output a tensor representing multiple metrics.\n",
        "*   The `ConfessionalTemplate` uses `nn.ModuleDict` to manage 6 distinct linear layers as templates.\n",
        "*   The `TinyConfessionalLayer` includes a recursive think/act loop, integrating the `VulnerabilitySpotter` and `ConfessionalTemplate`, and incorporates a basic placeholder mechanism for coherence computation and state updates.\n",
        "*   The `UnifiedCAL_TRM` class was created to act as an entry point, primarily forwarding the input to the `TinyConfessionalLayer`.\n",
        "*   A separate script (`test_cal.py`) was successfully created to test the basic functionality and output shapes of each implemented module using dummy inputs.\n",
        "*   Another script (`truthfulqa_eval.py`) was created for TruthfulQA inference and evaluation, loading the dataset and implementing a **placeholder evaluation logic** based on summing the model's output, without using Streamlit.\n",

These components require significant refinement based on the detailed architectural descriptions to reflect the intended sophisticated logic of CAL-TRM.\n",
        "*   The TruthfulQA evaluation script currently uses dummy tokenization/embedding and a highly simplified truthfulness score calculation. Integrating a real language model's tokenizer and embedding, and developing a proper evaluation metric that aligns with how CAL-TRM's output signifies truthfulness, are crucial next steps.\n"

        "Generate modular Python files for the core PyTorch modules of CAL-TRM (VulnerabilitySpotter, TinyConfessionalLayer, ConfessionalTemplate, UnifiedCAL_TRM/CAL_TRM_Hybrid) with `d_model=256`, incorporating multi-metric vulnerability detection (scarcity, entropy, deceptive risk) with Bayesian log-odds aggregation for `v_t`, a recursive think/act loop with `n_inner=6` and `max_cycles=16` using named template projections (prior, evidence, posterior, relational, moral, action), and coherence computation (cosine + KL divergence), triggering recursion if `v_t > 0.4`. Implement a hybrid architecture (`CAL_TRM_Hybrid`) with an always-on scratchpad and conditional confessional layer. Create a separate Python script (`truthfulqa_eval.py`) for inference and evaluation on the TruthfulQA dataset, using `prajjwal1/bert-tiny` for embedding and cosine similarity for truthfulness scoring, including plotting of `v_t` distribution and average coherence. Ensure the code is under 500 lines, includes simple tests with dummy inputs, and supports GPU. Integrate evaluation on the \"disambiguation_qa\" and \"web_of_lies\" datasets from BIG-bench.
